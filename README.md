# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to modify our PlanMyTrip project to allow users to more easily customize their vacation plans.  We have now allowed for users to input their weeather preferences for their travel destinations, and, upon selecting several cities that the user would like to visit, we now can generate a travel route between these cities to help the user visualize the destinations that they will travel to.  In addition to this, the map of cities that the user selected will display, in addition to the local weather, other travel information that would be useful for tourists (like the name of nearby hotels).
